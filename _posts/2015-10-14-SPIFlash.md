#[SPIFlash Library](http://marzogh.github.io/SPIFlash) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Marzogh/SPIFlash.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Marzogh/SPIFlash)

### Arduino library for Winbond Flash Memory Chips

<sup>Download the latest stable release (v2.1.0) from <a href = "http://www.github.com/Marzogh/SPIflash/releases/latest"> here </a>. Please report any bugs in issues.</sup>

This library is for a the Winbond serial flash memory chips.
In its current form it enables reading and writing almost all kinds of data from and to various locations in the flash memory; sector, block and chip erase; and powering down for low power operation.
It is able to detect the type of flash chip being used and sets parameters based on that.

Currently tested & compatible with Arduino 1.6.5 and the Arduino Uno, Arduino Leonardo, Arduino Mega and the Arduino Due.

All stable versions of this library are available from the Library Manager in the Arduino IDE. folder.
