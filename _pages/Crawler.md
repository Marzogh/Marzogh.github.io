# [The Crawler Project](http://marzogh.github.io/The-Crawler-Project)

This is an autonomously navigating robot built around a Maxstone/HSP 1/5th size RC Rock Crawler chassis.

There is no final design - every step is to be an evolutionary one with new functions and improvements to existing functions coming as I learn and refine my hardware hacking/building and software writing skills.

Please feel free to take the code and modify it for use in your robots. Just make sure you leave the accreditation bit at the top of the code and add your details to it.
